# 1.1 Introduction
- This is a DSA Laboratory final Group Project, allowing students to practice knowledge about Algorithms, Complexity and Data Structures by creating
  a game with Java coding language. Additionally, students can implement advanced features or revise curriculum through the game development 

# 1.2 Game Rules
Locate and eliminate enemy's ships before they do!

- Each player begins with a 10x10 grid and place 5 ships on their grid. All ships are 1 unit wide,
    and with lengths of 5, 4, 3, 3, and 2. These ships can be placed either horizontally or vertically.

- After the preparation stage of placing ships the game alternates between players allowing
    them to select one new position on the opponent’s grid that has not yet been attacked.
  
- The positions are marked once they have been attacked. Red = Hit, Blue = Miss

- Ships which are completely destroyed will be revealed their position on that player's grid.

- Player whose still have remaining ships is the winner.



# 1.3 Algorithms

- Shuffle Algroithms
- Random Algorithms


# 1.4 Future Implementation
- Improve interface, additionally implement user customization for the ships and grids, etc.
- Add different gameplay elements, for example: count down clock, effect items, preset modes, etc.
- Add coreboard and perfomance analysis
- Add Sound system for better experience
